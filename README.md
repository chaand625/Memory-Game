# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

 Open the index.html to start the game. Click the cards to open it. Cards are opened if the next card matches with the previous one else both cards are closed. Make as less moves as possilbe to increase the rating. Once all cards are opened you won the game.

## How did i do ?

 I have downloaded the project from the link provided by the **Udacity**. I have read all the requirements and the comments in app.js file. Reading the **CSS** file I understood the point in changing the cards views. 

 Storing the cards into and array and shuffling them make them random everytime a new game is opened.

 Then storing the clicked card in an array and comparing them everytime a click is done on card, the game is procceded.

 Once all cards are opened a alert is displayed with the time, rating and move.

### SweetAlert

  I have used the sweetalert package to have a pretty looking alert to the user.

### Conclusion

 I really enjoyed the **DOM** manipulations working with the project. It's really interesting to know how **DOM** can be used for changing CSS properties for simple workflow.
